Hello, Doctor!
Hello! How can I assist you today?
I don’t really know anybody. And most of them hate me anyway.
I’m sorry to hear that you feel that way. It can be difficult to feel like you don’t have anyone to turn to or that people don’t like you. Can you tell me more about why you feel like most people hate you?
Well, those who don't hate me just haven't had a chance to meet me yet. Once they will, I'm sure they wouldn't want me around.	
It sounds like you have a negative perception of yourself and your ability to connect with others. It’s important to remember that everyone has unique qualities and strengths that make them valuable and interesting. It’s also important to recognize that not everyone will like us, and that’s okay. It’s more important to focus on building positive relationships with those who do appreciate us for who we are. Have you considered seeking out new social opportunities or trying to connect with people who share similar interests?
Well, actually…I just don’t fit in. I don’t do things right and am always making mistakes. I’m sure everyone thinks I’m stupid. Besides, why should anyone want to be around me? My mother works for Mr. Major; I’m sure people think I’m his spy.
It sounds like you have a lot of negative thoughts and beliefs about yourself that are impacting your self-esteem and ability to connect with others. It’s important to remember that making mistakes is a normal part of the learning process, and it doesn’t make you stupid. It’s also important to recognize that other people’s opinions of you are not always accurate or fair. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about these feelings? They can help you work through these negative thoughts and develop a more positive self-image. Additionally, it may be helpful to focus on your strengths and interests, and seek out social opportunities where you can connect with others who share those interests.
Oh no! That would show them just how stupid I was. I couldn't do that. I don't dare. Oh no. I wouldn't dare ask anyone for help. I ask my mother sometimes because I trust her. But she's usually busy doing other things and doesn't really have time for me.
It’s understandable that you may feel hesitant to seek help or support from others, especially if you feel like you might be judged or rejected. However, it’s important to remember that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to reach out and ask for support when we need it. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to a therapist or counselor, there are other options available to you. You could consider joining a support group or online community where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences. You could also try reaching out to a trusted friend or family member who you feel comfortable talking to. Remember, you don’t have to go through this alone.
No, not really...not all of them, anyway. I have many distant cousins. Someone in my family is always getting married or has a new person in their life. It's those ones--the ones that I'm not familiar with--that make me feel...
well, it’s understandable to feel uncomfortable or anxious around people you don’t know well, especially if you’re not sure how to connect with them. It can be helpful to remember that everyone has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and it’s okay to take time to get to know someone before feeling comfortable around them. You could try starting a conversation by asking them about their interests or hobbies, or sharing something about yourself that you think they might find interesting. Remember, building relationships takes time and effort, but it can be a rewarding experience.
