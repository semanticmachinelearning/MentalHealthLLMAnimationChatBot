It happens to everyone sooner or later. If you haven't felt it yet, you will. Everyone will. And not just this city either, I can tell you that. We're in for big trouble. And the damn authorities aren't doing one single thing about it. Serve the whole city right when this thing rears up and bites them in the ass. You'd think with all the evidence mounting up someone would sure as hell listen. But no. They leave it to a couple of us to deal with the problem. Freaking politicians.

I knew I should’ve taken it a lot slower. It’s just that I get fired up and can’t talk fast enough to get everything out that I want to say. It’s just like those other times. Either I talk too much about stuff I don’t need to talk about or I don’t talk enough about the important stuff. I tell you, Doc, sometimes I just don’t know where to begin. There’s so much to worry about and so little time. I’m not getting anywhere with this problem, see, and it’s driving me nuts. I was hoping you’d be the one to listen. I nosed around and made inquiries, you know? No one knows I’m coming to see you but I did my homework. You seemed to be the guy with the best reputation so I made the appointment.

I don't have lots of friends anymore and if they found out I was here telling you about this, I wouldn't have any. Christ, I'm going to need all the help I can get. And I have to go slow and be careful. No one believes me, so if you don't mind, I'd like to just keep this between me and you. Oh damn, sorry about the mess, Doc.\\t. That's all right, Mr. Freeman. It's just water. These napkins will clean that right up. Do your hands often tremble…. Hey, Doc, how about calling me Jerry, okay?\\t. As you wish Jerry. Anything you tell me is held in strictest confidence. Except for certain legal obligations I have if I think you or someone else is in imminent danger of bodily harm, there's no way anyone will ever know what we've discussed in this room, Jerry. I do make notes for myself regarding our sessions, but they are under lock and key and no one has access but me. I'm really careful about it. I wanted to ask about your hands.  does that happen frequently?. Well, Doc. You know. When I'm at a bar and start slopping my drink all over the place. Or when I'm on the job and I start dropping equipment or pulling the cables out of their moorings, stuff like that. Or if I'm driving and have to pull over for a few minutes, especially if my girl is with me. It's only been really bad once that I remember. God was that a mess. We were at this Denny's you know? Waitress was walking by with a tray full of pancakes and I had just started the shakes--like a real spazoid--and was getting up to go to the can. I didn't see her coming and jumped up right into her. Man, that food went everywhere. Syrup, butter, sausage, bacon...looked like a damn food fight. I sure got out of there as fast as I could, you can bet on that. But most of the time, it's no big deal.\\t. You said earlier that you don't have a lot of friends, but you mentioned your girl. Is she one of them?. Goddamn it, Doc!. She's not one of Them and if you're....oh, I see what you meant. Not one of Them but one of my friends. Sorry to go off on you like that, Doc. Well, she's not my girlfriend in the usual way, know what I mean? I mean, she's like my steady hired girlfriend. We're close and all that but it's not like we're going steady or going to get married or anything like that.\\t. \\tHave you sought medical treatment for this condition? Are you taking any medication?\\t. Naw. As I said, Doc, it just isn't that big a thing. It doesn't bother me much really and it never lasts long. I can live with it. See--I'm already over it. No need to bother with it, Doc. If that's all I had to worry about, my life wouldn't be such a fucking...ah shit, Doc, said it again.\\t. That's okay Jerry. I've heard it before and I'm not offended by profanity. What's important is that you express what really on your mind. After all, that's why you're here.. I've got to hand it to you, Doc. You sure do make a person feel welcome here. I already can see I'm two lengths ahead of where I was with those other doctors. Anyway, I don't need no medicine because I've got to keep my head clear. These shakes don't mean a thing compared to what's ahead, you know?\\t. No I don't know. What do you mean?\\t. Doc, let me ask you something. Have you ever wondered about what's beneath this city of ours? You ever been walking to your car at night or going to lunch during the day and felt someone watching you? Ever get that greasy feeling that comes when someone's eyeballing you and you don't really know where it's coming from?\\t. Well Jerry…. Ah that's okay, Doc. You don't have to answer. It happens to everyone sooner or later. If you haven't felt it yet, you will. Everyone will. And not just this city either, I can tell you that. We're in for big trouble. And the damn authorities aren't doing one single thing about it. Serve the whole city right when this thing rears up and bites them in the ass. You'd think with all the evidence mounting up someone would sure as hell listen. But no. They leave it to a couple of us to deal with the problem. Freaking politicians. I tell you, Doc, all of humanity--men, women and children--are in for a rude awakening. That day is coming, sure as sh...uh, sure as I'm sitting here.. Well Mr. Freeman, I'm still not sure I understand what the threat is that you're talking about. But we're almost out of time for this session. It sounds like we've got a lot to discuss in future sessions.. What’s the matter, Doc? Cutting me short? You think I’m crazy, don’t you? Well hell. I knew I should’ve taken it a lot slower. It’s just that I get fired up and can’t talk fast enough to get everything out that I want to say. It’s just like those other times. Either I talk too much about stuff I don’t need to talk about or I don’t talk enough about the important stuff. I tell you, Doc, sometimes I just don’t know where to begin. There’s so much to worry about and so little time. I’m not getting anywhere with this problem, see, and it’s driving me nuts. I was hoping you’d be the one to listen. I nosed around and made inquiries, you know? No one knows I’m coming to see you but I did my homework. You seemed to be the guy with the best reputation so I made the appointment. Guess I’ve scared you off, right?. Absolutely not Jerry. I think we've made excellent progress for a first session. You've done just fine, Jerry.. nan. nan. nan. nan. nan. nan. nan. nan. nan\""

            "Um, I answer the phone for Mr. Utterman and handle his correspondence. I filter out the sales calls and direct them to the proper sales person. I do other things like typing and filing. Mr. Utterman doesn't like me very much. I think I make too many mistakes and that upsets him.\n",
            "I see. It sounds like you have a lot of responsibilities at your job, and it’s understandable that you might make mistakes from time to time. It’s also understandable that your mother is concerned about you losing your job. Have you talked to your mother about how you’re feeling about your job and your relationship with Mr. Utterman?\n",

It’s important to remember that everyone has unique qualities and strengths that make them valuable and interesting. It’s also important to recognize that not everyone will like us, and that’s okay. It’s more important to focus on building positive relationships with those who do appreciate us for who we are. Have you considered seeking out new social opportunities or trying to connect with people who share similar interests?\n",
            "Well, actually…I just don’t fit in. I don’t do things right and am always making mistakes. I’m sure everyone thinks I’m stupid. Besides, why should anyone want to be around me? My mother works for Mr. Major; I’m sure people think I’m his spy.\n",

It’s important to remember that making mistakes is a normal part of the learning process, and it doesn’t make you stupid. It’s also important to recognize that other people’s opinions of you are not always accurate or fair. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about these feelings? They can help you work through these negative thoughts and develop a more positive self-image. Additionally, it may be helpful to focus on your strengths and interests, and seek out social opportunities where you can connect with others who share those interests.\n",
            "Oh no! That would show them just how stupid I was. I couldn't do that. I don't dare. Oh no. I wouldn't dare ask anyone for help. I ask my mother sometimes because I trust her. But she's usually busy doing other things and doesn't really have time for me.\n",
            "It’s understandable that you may feel hesitant to seek help or support from others, especially if you feel like you might be judged or rejected. However, it’s important to remember that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to reach out and ask for support when we need it. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to a therapist or counselor, there are other options available to you. You could consider joining a support group or online community where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences. You could also try reaching out to a trusted friend or family member who you feel comfortable talking to. Remember, you don’t have to go through this alone.\n",
            "No, not really...not all of them, anyway. I have many distant cousins. Someone in my family is always getting married or has a new person in their life. It's those ones--the ones that I'm not familiar with--that make me feel...\n",
            "well, it’s understandable to feel uncomfortable or anxious around people you don’t know well, especially if you’re not sure how to connect with them. It can be helpful to remember that everyone has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and it’s okay to take time to get to know someone before feeling comfortable around them. You could try starting a conversation by asking them about their interests or hobbies, or sharing something about yourself that you think they might find interesting. Remember, building relationships takes time and effort, but it can be a rewarding experience. Hey. You Doc Balis?\n",
            "Hello! I’m not Doc Balis, but I’m a virtual psychiatrist here to assist you. How can I help you today?\n",
            "Thanks, Doc. You mind if I call you that? Some doctors get all put out when you shorten it.\n",
            "Of course, you can call me Doc. How can I assist you today?\n",
            "You’re quick, Doc. I’ll have to remember that. Yeah, I’ve been to a few in recent years. Never seem to hang on for very long though. Usually get cold feet when we finally get to the real crux of it.\n",
            "I understand. It’s common to feel hesitant or anxious when discussing sensitive topics in therapy. However, it’s important to remember that therapy is a safe and confidential space where you can explore your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Would you like to talk about what’s been holding you back in therapy?\n",
            "Hey now, Doc. Hold on. Not so fast. We’ll get to that soon enough. But I got to know something right away before we keep on getting on.\n",
            "Sure, what would you like to know?\n",
            "Are you one of Them?\n",
            "I’m sorry, I’m not sure what you mean by “Them.” Could you please clarify?\n",
            "Whew. Okay. You're clean. You know, that's the one way you can tell they're Them. They simply can't lie worth a crap. Which works for us because, without that little flaw, we'd be like ducks on a pond. If you were one of Them, you'd have had to say you were. Now at least we can start this association with a clean slate since you're okay.\n",
            "I’m glad to hear that you feel comfortable talking to me. As a virtual psychiatrist, my primary goal is to provide a safe and supportive space for you to explore your thoughts and feelings. I’m here to help you work through any challenges you may be facing and to support you in achieving your goals. Is there anything specific you’d like to discuss today?\n",
            "All in due time, Doc. Hey, I hope I haven’t busted your nuts putting you through that little test. It’s just sort of a defense mechanism I’ve developed over the last couple of years. You just have to be so careful, know what I’m saying? By the way, Doc, think I could have a glass of water?\n",
            "Of course, I understand. It’s important to be cautious and protect yourself. As for the water, I’m sorry, but as a virtual psychiatrist, I’m not able to provide physical items like water. However, I’m here to listen and support you in any way I can. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n",
            "Well you'd probably be edgy too, if....uh...Doc, what are you writing down there?\n",
            "I’m sorry, but as a virtual psychiatrist, I’m not writing anything down. Our conversation is confidential and secure, and I’m here to listen and support you. Is there anything specific you’d like to discuss today?\n",
