Nina. Please call me Nina.
Of course, Nina. How are you feeling today?
Well, my mom thinks you can help me.
I’m glad to hear that your mom thinks I can help. What brings you to seek therapy?
She wants me to keep my job.
I see. Can you tell me more about your job and why your mom thinks you might lose it?
At SII. I work with my mother.
I understand. It sounds like your job is important to you and your family. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on at work that’s causing concern?
No, she has a good job working for Mr. Majors...sorry, I mean Mr. Major. She has been working for him for a long time. She arranged for my job.
I see. It sounds like your job is important to both you and your mother. Can you tell me more about why your mother is concerned that you might lose your job?
Um, I answer the phone for Mr. Utterman and handle his correspondence. I filter out the sales calls and direct them to the proper sales person. I do other things like typing and filing. Mr. Utterman doesn't like me very much. I think I make too many mistakes and that upsets him.
I see. It sounds like you have a lot of responsibilities at your job, and it’s understandable that you might make mistakes from time to time. It’s also understandable that your mother is concerned about you losing your job. Have you talked to your mother about how you’re feeling about your job and your relationship with Mr. Utterman?
Yes. This is my first real job, and it's real important to Mama that I do well. But...
But what, Nina? It’s okay to share your thoughts and feelings with me.
I want to make her proud of me.
It’s understandable that you want to make your mother proud of you, Nina. It’s also important to remember that you are your own person, and you deserve to feel proud of yourself too. It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to do well at your job. Have you talked to your mother about how this pressure is affecting you?
I'd like to go now. I don't really think this is a good idea.
Of course, Nina. It’s okay to take some time to think about whether therapy is right for you. If you ever feel like you want to talk, I’m here to listen.
I just...I have a hard time with new people, and you make me nervous. I'm sorry! I didn't mean to insult you. See? I just end up putting my foot in my mouth and making things worse all the time.
It’s okay, Nina. You didn’t insult me, and there’s no need to apologize. It’s understandable to feel nervous around new people, and it’s okay to make mistakes. We all make mistakes sometimes. If you ever feel like talking again, I’m here to listen.
I don't...is it scary for you, too?
As an AI language model, I don’t experience emotions like humans do, so I don’t feel scared. However, I understand that it can be scary to talk to someone new, especially about personal issues. It’s okay to take your time and only share what you feel comfortable sharing.
